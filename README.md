## Day 4 — Productivity sprint

**Company:** <COMPANY>
**Time:** 45 minutes (timeboxed)

### Edit notes (3 lines)

1. Gamma confabulated a "hiring 50,000 freshers in 2025" stat on slide 6. Source said 40,000. Edited.
2. Slide 4 listed "Kubernetes" as a required skill — actually nice-to-have per the JD. Edited.
3. Slide 1 (cover) — replaced Gamma's generic "Your Career Awaits" with a company-specific line.


## Day 5 Lab 5B — Hugging Face Pulls

### Models tested
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli` — zero-shot classification
- `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` — sentiment

### Timing comparison

| | min | avg | Notes |
|---|-----|-----|-------|
| HF Inference API | 0.8s | 1.2s | Cold-start: 20s |
| Local in Colab | 2.1s | 3.4s | Download: 60s on first run |

### When to use each (3-line reflection)

1. **API:** for low-volume, occasional calls. Avoids download. Cold-start risk on first call after idle.
2. **Local:** for batch processing 100+ items, where you want predictable latency and don't pay per call.
3. **Production rule of thumb:** if your usage exceeds the API free tier (~30K requests/month at HF), self-host. Otherwise API.


## Day 6 Lab 6A — Errors handled

1. **Markdown fence wrapping** (`\`\`\`json ... \`\`\``)
   The retry prompt asks Gemini to output raw JSON without fences. Triggers on ~5-10% of calls.

2. **Hallucinated phone number when source has none**
   `Optional[str] = None` in Pydantic — model returns `null`, schema validates.

3. **Empty / whitespace-only input**
   Pydantic raises ValidationError with "Field required". Caller catches.

**Hallucination on garbage input:** Gemini sometimes invents a plausible résumé from non-résumé text. Defence: validate input before sending (e.g., minimum length, presence of email-like pattern).


## Day 6 — Capstone Sprint 1: PlacementDataProcessor

### Engineer Answer

1. **PROBLEM** — JDs from Naukri / LinkedIn are messy text — placement cells need structured data to filter ("which JDs want Java + CGPA 7+?"). Manual extraction is unscalable for 50+ JDs.

2. **ARCHITECTURE** — JD URL → BeautifulSoup scraper (extract clean text) → Gemini structured-output call (response_schema=JD Pydantic) → JSON Lines file. Validation at each step; retry on schema fail.

3. **TRADE-OFFS** —
   - Cost: free Gemini ~1 JD/sec on average; ~30K tokens/day quota → ~5K JDs/day.
   - Accuracy: Pydantic catches schema violations but not semantic errors (e.g., model says skill is "Python" when source says "Python 3.12 specifically").
   - Latency: ~2-5s per JD (Gemini call dominant).
   - Complexity: scraping fragile (sites block automation). Cached fallback is mandatory.

4. **SCALE** —
   - 10 JDs/day: trivial. Today's lab.
   - 100 JDs/day: still in free quota. Add overnight batch + sleep between calls.
   - 10K JDs/day: free tier breaks. Move to paid Gemini OR self-host an open model.

5. **INTERVIEW ANSWER** — "I built a structured-output pipeline that turns scraped JDs into clean filterable JSON, using free Gemini and Pydantic. Schema-first design with retry-on-failure made it production-shaped on a free-tier API."

- `Day6_PlacementProcessor.ipynb` — the notebook
- `data/jds.jsonl` — output of this sprint, input for Day 7 RAG

### Pair: <Mentor 1 name> + <Mentor 2 name>

## Day 7 Lab 7A — ChromaDB Hello-World

- Embedded 10 CSE Sem 5 paragraphs with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim, free)
- Indexed in persistent ChromaDB collection `hello_syllabus`
- Ran 3 semantic queries — observed: top-1 match is relevant when query topic is in corpus, irrelevant when not
- Plotted PCA 2D — visible OS / DBMS clusters

**Reflection:** Semantic search returns nearest, not exact. RAG must enforce citations to catch out-of-corpus queries (this afternoon's Sprint 2).
